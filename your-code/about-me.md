My name is Paola Leguizamón, I am from Colombia and currently a Business Analyst at VOQIN’, a destination management and event production company with operations in Portugal, Spain, Brazil and Florida. I came to Portugal 3 years ago to study my master’s in management at Nova School of Business and Economics, with a Major in Strategy and International Business. I graduated in January 2018 and have been working in Lisbon ever since.

I strongly believe that the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp will provide me an excellent opportunity for me to become tangibly involved in the world of Data Analytics and learn all the tools and skills to thrive in a data analysis career path. After the Bootcamp, I would like to work in the Retail/Fashion industry as a business or data analyst.
